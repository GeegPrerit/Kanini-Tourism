## Features

### User Authentication

The platform provides user authentication for different roles:

- **Travelers and Travel Agents:** Users can create accounts, log in, and access their respective dashboards. Travelers can explore available tours, while travel agents can manage their tour plans.
- **Admins:** Administrators have a dedicated panel to manage user approvals, gallery images, and overall system administration.

### Travel Agents

Travel agents have specialized features:

- Create and Manage Tour Plans: Travel agents can create and manage detailed tour plans. These plans include information about destinations, itineraries, pricing, and images.
- Approval Workflow: Newly created tour plans have an "Approval Status" initially set to "Not Approved". Admins are responsible for reviewing and approving these plans before they are visible to travelers.

### Admins

Admins have powerful control over the platform:

- User and Plan Approval: Admins can approve travel agents and their submitted tour plans. This ensures quality and authenticity of the offerings.
- Gallery Management: Admins can manage the images that appear in the gallery section of the website. This helps showcase enticing visuals to potential travelers.

### Travelers

Travelers enjoy user-friendly features:

- Browse Tours: Travelers can explore the collection of available tour plans. Detailed descriptions, images, itineraries, and pricing help travelers make informed decisions.
- Booking Process: Once a traveler finds a preferred tour, they can easily book it through the platform. A booking confirmation is generated, and travelers can also download a PDF version of their confirmation.
